Hello, World!

This is the first post in what will hopefully be a rather prolific blog. For the longest time, I've want to start a blog, but I could never find the time. Admittedly, though, I never really tried. But now, after a couple of weeks of taking it slow and decompressing after a rather rough semester, I think the summer will give me such an opportunity. That's not to say I'm exactly swimming in free time - I'm working at both my [lab at ASU][1] and for [KDNuggets][2] - but I do have a little bit of wiggle room now that all of the hustle of the semester is over.

So what will I write about? I'll probably start with the project I'm working on currently that I'm actually passionate about, which is TwitTP. What I'm doing for this project is using ML to attempt to predict trends on Twitter ahead of time. I've done a little bit of the build-up work such as gathering data and attempting some naive (and very poorly performing) models, but I have quite a lot of work ahead of me and I will likely be working on this problem or something related to it for the next year as I begin my honors thesis. Other things I may write about include other smaller programming side-projects, CS tutorial types of posts, Haskell, music, or motorcycles, depending on my mood.

If that all sounds interesting, please check back often. If there's anything you'd like to say to me about the site or any content on the site, feel free to [email me][3]. The next post I write will probably be another meta-post about what the site is running on and my experiences finding a setup that works well.

Until next time,

Grant
