This is both my personal and my professional website. I have some links to my past work on this about page and plan on writing posts on whatever is interesting to me (CS / Math / Music / Whatever). Check back regularly if you're interested in what I'm working on and feel free to contact me through the information in the footer.

Projects

<h3>NIF-T</h3>

Navigating Information Facets on Twitter (NIF-T) is a program I wrote as part of a [Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiatives][2] (FURI) grant to create intuitive methods for visualizing the huge quantity of data locked away in tweets. It was the first large-scale project I worked on during my college career. It was also the first project I did as part of the [Data Mining and Machine Learning lab][1] (DMML) at ASU and the first (and last) project I wrote in PHP. It was a very good learning experience and taught me many things to *not* do when creating a web-based application. NIF-T was [published][4] as a demo paper at KDD 2012.

<h3>ClinicMate</h3>

ClinicMate is a program I wrote during my second year at ASU as the final project for my software engineering class. It was a group project that I worked on with Amy Baldwin, Dan Howe, and Mark Karlsrud. This was the first time I had to work on the actual programming collaboratively with other people. Because we all needed to be able to understand the code, it was written in Java, which is the main teaching language at ASU. Working collaboratively with others on the code was probably the most interesting part of the project. You can find the source code [here][3].

<h3>Kraken</h3>

Kraken is a program that I wrote to distribute load in genomic data extraction pipelines for TGen during my time as a Helios scholar there during the Summer of 2013. It was written in Perl because that is the scripting language that I could rely on every server in the HPC cluster being able to run (other than Bash) and everyone in the lab group understood Perl. It started out small, but quickly sprawled out into being fairly sophisticated, being able to drop in different analysis modules and distribute loads depending on the size of the data sets and experiments I conducted to measure runtimes. This is what gave it the name. Having the chance to play around with Moose, an object system written for Perl, and systems with multiple terrabytes of memory was a fun experience.

<h3>GrCal</h3>

GrCal is a program written in Haskell for my Intermediate Abstract Algebra honors contract in the Spring of 2014. Its purpose is to perform simple operations on Groups (the algebraic structure). This was a very fun project because it was my first project to make use of Haskell, which has since become my favorite pet language. As a part of the honors contract requirements, I made a write-up explaining some functions and examples of using the program which you can see [here][5]. The source code can also be found [here][6].
